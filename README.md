# Metamask-Assessment

Given the context of smart contracts and their features, this completes module 2 of our ETH + AVAX Assessment.

# Description

By providing ETH and depositing it, the Metamask Assessment is accomplished. We were able to create and control how we could access ETHs, run them through VS Code, and maintain them running inside a browser by using Localhost and VS Code. We can learn how to effectively limit within Metamask and through the front-end and back-end thanks to functions like npm and npx.

# Starter Next/Hardhat Project

After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
